"# REInvesting" 

This file describes a brief, high-level explanation of this application

1. To run this locally you must download node.js. Refer to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for the download based on your system.
        -Having node, you now have the ability to use 'npm' on the Command Line/Terminal.
2. Now refer to https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html to download express for the server module. 
        -Make sure you download express in the current repository you're in.
3. Once you have both of these setup, you can now navigate to this repo on your local system and run: 'node app.js' to start the project locally.
        -In browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see index.html page.

I have included a batch file that should be adjusted based on the file path of your project. Essentially the file should navigate to the directory that your project is in and then run 'node app.js' to start the local server. Still navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in browser.

Home page:
        Currently a expense break down with a responsive bar chart. We can include income and NET income after expenses to help investors see where their budget is and where they can see improvements. This will need to go in its own page but for now I messed around on the homepage with it.

AngularTest page:
        Test page to get angular working right with js. Test purposes only
        
Budget page:
        Allows for input of income vs expenses with a bar graph of expenses and a donut graph looking at expenses vs income.
        Will allow user to increase/descrease number of expense/income input boxes. Will clean up page with CSS. Will have a save feature to allow users to keep track of their profiles.

More to come...
